The "performance" is the number of rows at which the chart resize starts to jitter visibly (<10fps)

# Chart.js

Can dynamically update the config, but on serie data change, redraws the whole serie

Errors are hard to understand. API can feel awkward. I just couldn't make a linechart with time x axis. The code from the official demo didn't work.

# React Charts

Docs is very sparse, mostly consisting in a huge codesandbox with all the examples that you have to reverse engineer to understand how things work.

I couldn't really distinguish bugs from misconfigurations.

Options are not JSDoc'ed so that makes things even more difficult.
